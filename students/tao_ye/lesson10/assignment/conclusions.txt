A decorator function 'timer()' is added to log the timing information for the
three functions in HP Norton application: import_data, 
show_available_products, and show_rentals. And data files have around 
1000 records each.

To run the script, type
>python database.py

It will output timing information to a file 'timings.txt' and onto the
console.

The timing information saved in timings.txt is listed below:

Function 'import_data' processed 3005 records in 1.6500 secs
Function 'show_available_products' processed 600 records in 0.0375 secs
Function 'show_rentals' processed 811 records in 0.5322 secs

As it can be seen, the 'import_data' and 'show_rentals' functions took much
longer time than 'show_available_products' function, and seem to be the bottle 
neck. 

Upon further examination, 'show_rentals' likely took more time than 
'import_data' if the number of records processed by the 'show_rentals' function
is increased to around 3000, similar to that of 'import_data' function 
assuming a linear relationship between the time consumed and the number of 
records processed.

In addition, the 'show_rentals' function is probably also used a lot more
often than the "import_data" function, hence, the 'show_rentals' function could 
be the root cause for the system performance issue.
