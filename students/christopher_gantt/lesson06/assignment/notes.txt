Performance Notes:

1. 7.435 runtime for poor_perf.py using time.perf_counter()
	
2. 5.393 runtime - Take away opening file twice and running two for loops

3. 5.243 Merge main() and analyze() functions

4. 4.205 Take away new_ones, loop through csv only once

5. 3.764 Remove lrow, no longer creating a list of each row I iterate through.

6. 2.832 Removed 6 if statements to check for year, replaced with try: year_count[row[5][6:]]+=1

Summary: Started at 7.435 second runtime and ended at 2.832 seconds, a 4.603 second improvement
