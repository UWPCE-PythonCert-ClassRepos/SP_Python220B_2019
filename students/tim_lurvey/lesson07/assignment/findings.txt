Assignment 07 findings
-------------------------
1.  I thoroughly enjoyed this lesson.  I have dabbled in threading with some applications
    written, but never to this level.  I really wanted to understand and make the
    assignment work with async programming, having never successfully implemented it.

2.  asyncio was more difficult that using drop-in threading but I feel confident to try
    it in the real world.

3.  My time improvement with async was not as much as expected, but I am not surprised
    that the databasing modules are well optimized themselves and everything is
    performed locally on disc.  I feel a ~30% improvement is respectable.

    By adding more and more data, the performance gains are more apparent.When I tried
    running a lot more operations with many many coroutines executing concurrently, the
    performance got better, as expected.  I expect to see further improvements with real
    world latency.
