Looking at the performance of inserting 300, 1500, and 3000 records, a concerning trend emerges:

# of records    Time Elapsed    % change in records     % increase
300             0.604s          N/A                     N/A
1500            2.972s          400%                    392%
3000            7.402s          100%                    149%

As the table above shows, performance between 300 and 1500 records is linear.  That is, inserting 5
times the records takes about 5 times as long.  However, between 1500 and 3000 records, twice as
many records take almost 2.5 times as long.  Depending on the expected growth of the rental business,
the team may want to spend time imoproving the database performance at scale.
